# SimpleShell Enhanced
## What is SimpleShell?
SimpleShell is a quick way to create commands, and control your arduino using the serial interface.

This fork aims to improve upon the original SimpleShell and continue maintaining the codebase.

```
Type 'help' for a list of commands.
> help
Usage:
	<command> [options]
Commands:
	helloworld	: Optional Description
>
```

Tab completion and descriptions will hopefully be supported someday.

## How to use it?
See `examples/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ino` for a simple example of a command.
